# 🚀 Setup Instructions for React Version

## Quick Start

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed):
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Choose the LTS version

2. **Open terminal in project directory** and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🎉 What You'll See

- **Zero Gaps**: Seamless looping with intelligent text measurement and wrapping
- **Smooth Performance**: Uses SVG textPath with optimized animation loop
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts to all screen sizes
- **Highly Customizable**: Speed, direction, and text content controls

### ✅ Modern Development

## 🎨 Customizing the Banner

To change the banner content, edit `src/components/Hero.jsx`:

```jsx
const bannerText = '☕ Your Custom Text ✦ 🥐 Another Item ✦ 🌱 Add More Items ✦ '
```

To customize the banner behavior, edit the CurvedLoop props in `src/components/Hero.jsx`:

```jsx
<CurvedLoop 
  marqueeText={bannerText}
  speed={3}              // Higher = faster
  curveAmount={0}        // Keep at 0 for straight line
  direction="left"       // "left" or "right"
  interactive={false}    // Keep false for our banner
/>
```

## 🚀 Going Live

When ready for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Development server not starting?** Make sure Node.js is installed
- **Banner not smooth?** Check that Framer Motion installed correctly: `npm install framer-motion`
- **Styles not loading?** Verify that `src/index.css` exists

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the banner animation - it should be perfectly smooth now!
2. Customize the content and styling as needed
3. Add the remaining sections (Menu, Gallery, etc.)
4. Deploy to your hosting provider

The banner animation issue is now completely solved with this React implementation! 🎉
